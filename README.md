# Acoustic-Fall-Severity-Classifier
AI-enabled acoustic monitoring system for detecting fall events and classifying their severity (High, Low, No-Fall). The project uses the SAFE dataset, audio preprocessing, STFT spectrograms, ConvNeXt-Tiny, and Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) to support privacy-preserving emergency detection.
